## PPHA 30535: Data and Programming for Public Policy I

This folder is composed with assignments that I've accomplished in one of my courses at the University of Chicago, Harris School of Public Policy. It is an introductory class to Python programming language that consists of the following:

-   Beginning Python, including logic control, loops, functions, classes, methods, and input-output

```
-   Data exploration and visualization (using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**)

-   Data APIs and web scraping (using **BeautifulSoup**)

-   Data analysis (using **Statsmodel**, **Numpy**, **Scikit-Learn**)

### Course Objectives

"This programming and data course is geared toward public policy students who have either no past programming experience, or minimal experience primarily in proprietary platforms like Stata and SAS. The goal is to prepare students both for future Harris courses and for entry-level positions working in policy research, such as (but not limited to) research assistants at policy institutions or as interns at think tanks. The content is drawn heavily from the professor's years of experience working at the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute in Washington, DC."
