## PPHA 30536: Data and Programming for Public Policy II

This folder is composed with assignments that I've accomplished in one of my courses at the University of Chicago, Harris School of Public Policy. This course builds directly on the materials covered in PPHA 30535, Data and Programming for Public Policy I. It focuses on practical applications to research using Python:

-   Natural language processing

-   Data visualization

-   Spatial data

-   Machine Learning

### Course Objectives

The goals of this course will be to:

-   Go from simply applying Python to solve research questions, to applying Python professionally, in a way that supports code maintenance, collaboration, efficiency, and readability

-   Deepen existing skills

-   Broaden into new skills that require higher level of Python proficiency

-   Prepare for the post-graduation job market

### Course Outline

1.  Code generalization and organization, functions, PEP8
2.  Irregularly shaped data
3.  Parsing data from PDF documents
4.  Natural Language Processing
5.  Data Visualization
6.  Spatial Data
7.  Intro to Machine Learning
8.  Common data languages
