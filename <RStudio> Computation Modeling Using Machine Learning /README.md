## MACS 30100: Perspectives on Computational Modeling

This folder is composed with assignments that I've accomplished in one of my courses at the University of Chicago. It is one of the core courses in the MACSS Perspectives sequence 'to develop an understanding of computational modeling that results in a well-stocked toolbox of computational methods and programming skills for solving social problems in a manner that mimics the real-world of problem solving.'

### Course Objectives

The course is designed to enable students to:

-   Define a range of statistical learning modeling strategies and demonstrate their properties

-   Distinguish between modeling strategies and assess their individual strengths and weaknesses

-   Implement models using open source computing using RStudio

-   Evaluate model performance

-   Interpret model results for inference and prediction

-   Visualize information and data using appropriate graphical techniques

### Course Outline

1.  Introduction and model building
2.  Computational foundations: Model-based programming, Feature engineering for missing data
3.  Model fitting, bias, and variance
4.  Resampling
5.  Regression problems
6.  Classification problems
7.  Nonlinear estimation
8.  Tree-based inference
9.  Support vector machines
10. Distance, clustering, partitioning
11. Dimension reduction, manifold learning
12. Artificial neural networks, self-organizing maps
13. Deep learning, autoencoders
14. Model-agnostic interpretation
