## PPHA 30545: Machine Learning

This folder is composed with assignments that I've accomplished in one of my courses at the University of Chicago, Harris School of Public Policy. This class will teach a set of tools to detect patterns in data to predict important outcomes or describe the salient relationships among inputs.

### Course Objectives

"The overall course objective is for students to be able to use machine learning techniques to carry out basic analyses that inform better policy and make the world a better place, as well as to become informed and critical consumers of policy recommendations based on machine learning techniques. Additionally, the course will allow students to market their newly gained machine learning knowledge and skills when applying for jobs."
